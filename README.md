# Bitcoin Price Prediction

## Description

This project aims to develop a working model that can predict the price of Bitcoin on a 1-day timeframe. Various approaches were explored, including LSTM models, plain machine learning models, and transformers. The dataset includes Bitcoin price, price indicators, capitalization, and the greed/fear index.

The most promising model was the transformer, which utilized several days of previous price history to predict Bitcoin prices two weeks ahead.
